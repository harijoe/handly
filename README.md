# Handly
A wrapper for serverless handlers to prevent silly mistakes, based on [middy](https://github.com/middyjs/middy)

## How to use it ?
Simply wrap your serverless handler like this :
```
import handly from 'handly'

const handler = async (event, context, callback) => {
  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: {
      message: {
        hello: 'world',
      },
    },
  };
};

export default handly(handler)
```

## How does it work ?
Handly wraps useful [middy](https://github.com/middyjs/middy) middlewares as well as other middlewares made by me.

### httpEventNormalizer
Adds `queryStringParameters` and `pathParameters` keys even though there are null to allow code such as to never throw :
```
event.pathParameters.userId
``` 

### httpHeaderNormalizer
Normalize http headers, for example `Content-type` becomes `Content-Type`

### jsonBodyParser
When `Content-Type` is set to `application/json`, this middleware parses the body automatically so that `event.body` becomes an object

### jsonBodyParser
When `Content-Type` is set to `application/json`, this middleware parses the body automatically so that `event.body` becomes an object

### urlEncodeBodyParser
Same as jsonBodyParser for `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`

### failsafe
This one is not a middy middleware but a wrapper which will return a 500 http response when an uncaught exception is thrown.
The default behavior is to return a 200 responseâ€¦

### normalizedResponse
Not official middy middleware. It automatically calls JSON.stringify on every response body. This is something mandatory with aws.
